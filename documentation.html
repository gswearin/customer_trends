		The very first thing I did to get started on this project was try to recreate the map using the line segment .csv file provided. This went hand-in-hand with doing a simple plot of the deaths and pumps on the map.
		My reasoning in doing this before any planning on the actual visualization was that, because I am still new to D3, and because of the limited time, it would put me at ease to see some sort of code-related progress as early as possible.
		<br><br>
		I used a variety of sources to accomplish these first two steps. For displaying the line segments, the most useful resource was Cook (2021), which included an interactive template that I could experiment with.
		It also allowed me to change the template version to v3 (the version I'm using), which gave me the chance to figure out what functionalities were not v3-compatible and how I needed to change them.
		<br><br>
		I also looked at Staroscik (2015) and Holtz (2018b) for reference.
		<br><br>
		I eventually became comfortable with how lines work in D3. A problem I ran into was that I was trying to append multiple separated line segments.
		At first, I used a <i>for</i> loop to append the many different lines. I then looked at Reda (2021b) and learned how to use .enter().append() in place of a <i>for</i> loop.
		<br><br>
		Points were easy after plotting the lines. I looked at Holtz (2018a) and Holtz (2018b) for a general idea on how plotting points differ from plotting lines.<br>

		<br>
		From here I had to start thinking about my design and how to convey the required information on the map (age and gender). Initially I had thought about using color for one of the variables and size for the other.
		This is the most obvious way I could think of to illustrate two additional variables onto a scatterplot. But there were some problems with this.
		Size would make the map very cluttered, and it was also counter-intuitive. Age does not have an intuitive relationship with size.
		<br><br>
		I decided on using color for both variables. Blue/red would denote gender (male/female respectively) and brightness would denote age.
		Intuitively, people view blue and red as male and female. I also perceieved lighter colors as looking "older."
		Implementing this idea was easy after doing some research on the hsl() and rgb() functions of D3.
		In retrospect, using color for age only and shape for gender might have resulted in a more interpretable plot, especially for color-blind people.
		<br><br>
		 I made the pumps gray to stand out from the map while also allowing the main attention to be placed on the deaths.
		<br><br>
		My next task was to create a timeline for the deaths. I decided on using a bar chart (more of a histogram in this case) for this.
		I could have used a connected dot plot, but I figured that bar charts would work better with the "hover-over" functionality, which will be discussed later.
		I placed the bar chart to the right of the map, so that both could easily be viewed at the same time.
		Making the bar chart was easy after my experience with appending lines and circles.
		I would just append rectangles with increasing x-values and y-values based on the appropriate .csv file.
		I went with orange for the color of the bar chart. I tried to use light colors in general for aesthetics, and I knew I would be using blue, yellow, and red for other parts of the visual.
		<br><br>
		I then had to make the bar chart interactive. Hovering over a certain bar should display the points up until that date.
		This was rather difficult. Schmidt (2019) and Reda (2021a) were good starting points for hovering/linking, but the main challenge was getting the bar chart to display points UNTIL that day, rather than ON that day.
		I ended up accomplishing this by using nested <i>for</i> loops to create an array <i>deaths_by_day</i>, which grouped the deaths, along with their location and other info, by day.
		From there, I could systematically name the ids of the timeline bars, and the classes of the death points, such that hovering over a bar would call for points with class numbers up until the bar's id number to be displayed.
		I later had to make an adjustment such that the user could choose the start date as well. I decided that since hovering was already used to determine the end date, clicking could be used to determine the start date.
		To make a bar appear as selected, I highlighted it blue, as this is how selected text is normally depicted.<br>

		<br>
		From here, I started working on the zooming and panning features of the map. I found some helpful examples on panning, including Pereira (2021), Johnson (2016), Navarro (2015), and d3noob (2021a).
		Navarro's example was most useful, since it used v3 specifically. But I needed to use all of them to truly get a sense of how the code was functioning and what variations would and would not work.
		My takeaway was that D3 handled the coordinates relating to the movement, but the event still had to be setup manually to make the object move to those coordinates while being dragged.
		It was also made more difficult by the fact that I had to be able to drag not a single object, but the entire set of objects lying upon a 'g' element.
		I used the transform() function to do this.
		<br><br>
		For zooming, I found Singh's 2015 example to be helpful.
		Surprisingly, the challenging part here was combining zooming and panning. Because both used transform() functions, they seemed to override each other.
		For example, the <i>zoom</i> transform would set the coordinates back to their default values. I ended up having to explicitly set the coordinates to their current values within the <i>zoom</i> transform to work around this.
		<br><br>
		The last challenging aspect of the project was clustering. My plan for showing clusters was to display gridlines on the map itself, and then portray the number of deaths in each cell both through a color gradient and a printed number.
		I did not need any explicit examples since I was familiar with everything I needed at this point.
		But printing out gridlines in the proper locations as well as the tiles within the cells indicating number involved a lot of nested <i>for</i> loops, fractions, and convoluted math.
		I was sure to write my code dependent on a parameter (number of clusters) that the user would be able to change as needed.<br>

		<p style = 'font-size: 18px;'>Some of the code for the clustering; this code determines if points are within each cluster</p>
		<p style = 'font-size: 24px;'>
		<br>
		My decision to place the grid on the map gave a sense of how the grid cells aligned with the deaths on the map.
		I was sure to give the grid a small amount of transparency such that the map was visible, but not so much so that the viewer would be overwhelmed.
		<br><br>
		Last, I had to show the general distributions of age and gender. I figured that bar charts would be a perfectly good way to illustrate this.
		This part was very easy overall and did not take too much time considering what I had done earlier.
		I needed side-by-side bars to show how the general age dsitribution compared with the age distribution of the victims.
		I chose yellow and purple as contrasting colors for the age distributions, and I again chose blue and red to represent male and female.
		<br><br>
		The final step was to properly label everything.
		Labeling street maps in their proper locations was a bit tricky, but I was able to speed up the process by first logging where I clicked my mouse, and then clicking on the locations of the streets for their approximate coordinates.
		The last online example I needed to reference was for rotating text (d3noob, 2021b). This was necessary for the positioning of some of the labels.
		<br><br>
		To show the work house and brewery on the map, I used yellow and purple squares. I wanted to choose two contrasting colors that would not clash with the blue and red points.
		<br><br>
		From here, I just polished up some small details of my design and checked for color-blindness issues with Color Oracle.
		<br><br>
		I was able to infer a great deal about the nature of this outbreak based on the visualization.
		Most of the deaths occured around the Broad Street pump, as John Snow found (Rogers, 2013). None of the other pumps had a high concentration of deaths around them.<br>

		<br>
		Additionally, I can conclude that children and elderly people were disproportionately affected, which makes sense considering that these groups generally have weaker immunity.
		The disease targeted males and females at about the same rate.<br>

		<br>
		This project was overall very difficult but a learning experience. I'm happy with how it turned out and I'm proud of myself for learning D3 in such a short time frame.
