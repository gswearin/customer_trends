		<p>This project was created by John Cochran and Garrett Swearingen for Dr. Khairi Reda's Data Visualization course at IUPUI during the Fall 2021 semester.
		   We aimed to provide tools to explore relationships between different factors relating to customer purchasing habits.
		   You can use this to investigate questions such as:</p>
		<p>-How does the income of a customer affect how much wine they are likely to purchase?</p>
		<p>-Do younger customers tend to buy their products through different means (e.g. web vs. store)?</p>
		<p>-In what ways are purchasing habits of people with children/teenagers different?</p>
		<p>The visualization contains three different views. Use the arrows under the visualization to navigate across the different views.</p>
